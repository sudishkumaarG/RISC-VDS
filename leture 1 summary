O1: Specification and Testbench
Begin with writing specifications using a C model.
Develop a testbench to validate functional behavior before hardware implementation.
This phase ensures clarity in design intent and sets the foundation for RTL development.

O2: RTL Development and Synthesis
Convert specifications into RTL using Verilog.
Define core components: processor and peripheral IPs.
Synthesize RTL into:
Gate-level netlists (for processor and digital logic).
Macros (pre-verified blocks reused across designs).
Analog IPs (functional blocks interfacing with physical signals).
This stage produces the soft copy of the hardware design.

O3: SoC Integration and Physical Design
Perform floorplanning, placement, routing, and timing closure.
Place macros and analog IPs in fixed locations to optimize layout reuse.
Finalize physical design into GDSII format.
Run DRC (Design Rule Check) and LVS (Layout Versus Schematic) to ensure fabrication readiness and logical correctness.
